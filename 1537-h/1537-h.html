<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Gower</span>.</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Before the palace of Antioch.</p>

<p>To sing a song that old was sung,<br/>
From ashes ancient Gower is come;<br/>
Assuming man&rsquo;s infirmities,<br/>
To glad your ear, and please your eyes.<br/>
It hath been sung at festivals,<br/>
On ember-eves and holy-ales;<br/>
And lords and ladies in their lives<br/>
Have read it for restoratives:<br/>
The purchase is to make men glorious,<br/>
<i>Et bonum quo antiquius eo melius.</i><br/>
If you, born in these latter times,<br/>
When wit&rsquo;s more ripe, accept my rhymes,<br/>
And that to hear an old man sing<br/>
May to your wishes pleasure bring,<br/>
I life would wish, and that I might<br/>
Waste it for you, like taper-light.<br/>
This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great<br/>
Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat;<br/>
The fairest in all Syria.<br/>
I tell you what mine authors say:<br/>
This king unto him took a fere,<br/>
Who died and left a female heir,<br/>
So buxom, blithe, and full of face,<br/>
As heaven had lent her all his grace;<br/>
With whom the father liking took,<br/>
And her to incest did provoke.<br/>
Bad child; worse father! to entice his own<br/>
To evil should be done by none:<br/>
But custom what they did begin<br/>
Was with long use account&rsquo;d no sin.<br/>
The beauty of this sinful dame<br/>
Made many princes thither frame,<br/>
To seek her as a bedfellow,<br/>
In marriage pleasures playfellow:<br/>
Which to prevent he made a law,<br/>
To keep her still, and men in awe,<br/>
That whoso ask&rsquo;d her for his wife,<br/>
His riddle told not, lost his life:<br/>
So for her many a wight did die,<br/>
As yon grim looks do testify.<br/>
What now ensues, to the judgement your eye<br/>
I give, my cause who best can justify.</p>

<h4><b>SCENE I. Antioch. A room in the palace.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Antiochus,</span> Prince <span class="charname">Pericles</span> and followers.</p>

<p>ANTIOCHUS.<br/>
Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received<br/>
The danger of the task you undertake.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul<br/>
Emboldened with the glory of her praise,<br/>
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</p>

<p>ANTIOCHUS.<br/>
Music! Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,<br/>
For the embracements even of Jove himself;<br/>
At whose conception, till Lucina reigned,<br/>
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,<br/>
The senate house of planets all did sit,<br/>
To knit in her their best perfections.</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Music. Enter the <span class="charname">Daughter</span> of Antiochus.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
See where she comes, apparell&rsquo;d like the spring,<br/>
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king<br/>
Of every virtue gives renown to men!<br/>
Her face the book of praises, where is read<br/>
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence<br/>
Sorrow were ever razed, and testy wrath<br/>
Could never be her mild companion.<br/>
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,<br/>
That have inflamed desire in my breast<br/>
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,<br/>
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,<br/>
As I am son and servant to your will,<br/>
To compass such a boundless happiness!</p>

<p>ANTIOCHUS.<br/>
Prince Pericles, &mdash;</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
That would be son to great Antiochus.</p>

<p>ANTIOCHUS.<br/>
Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,<br/>
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch&rsquo;d;<br/>
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:<br/>
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view<br/>
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;<br/>
And which, without desert, because thine eye<br/>
Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.<br/>
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,<br/>
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,<br/>
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,<br/>
That without covering, save yon field of stars,<br/>
Here they stand Martyrs, slain in Cupid&rsquo;s wars;<br/>
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist<br/>
For going on death&rsquo;s net, whom none resist.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught<br/>
My frail mortality to know itself,<br/>
And by those fearful objects to prepare<br/>
This body, like to them, to what I must;<br/>
For death remember&rsquo;d should be like a mirror,<br/>
Who tells us life&rsquo;s but breath, to trust it error.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll make my will then, and, as sick men do<br/>
Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,<br/>
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;<br/>
So I bequeath a happy peace to you<br/>
And all good men, as every prince should do;<br/>
My riches to the earth from whence they came;<br/>
[<i>To the daughter of Antiochus.</i>] But my unspotted fire of love to you.<br/>
Thus ready for the way of life or death,<br/>
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</p>

<p>ANTIOCHUS.<br/>
Scorning advice, read the conclusion, then:<br/>
Which read and not expounded, &rsquo;tis decreed,<br/>
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.</p>

<p>DAUGHTER.<br/>
Of all &rsquo;ssayed yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!<br/>
Of all &rsquo;ssayed yet, I wish thee happiness!</p>

<p>PERICLES<br/>
Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,<br/>
Nor ask advice of any other thought<br/>
But faithfulness and courage.</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>He reads the riddle.</i>]</p>

<p>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<i>I am no viper, yet I feed<br/>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†On mother&rsquo;s flesh which did me breed.<br/>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I sought a husband, in which labour<br/>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I found that kindness in a father:<br/>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†He&rsquo;s father, son, and husband mild;<br/>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I mother, wife, and yet his child.<br/>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†How they may be, and yet in two,<br/>
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†As you will live resolve it you.</i><br/>
</p>


<p>Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers<br/>
That give heaven countless eyes to view men&rsquo;s acts,<br/>
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,<br/>
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?<br/>
Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Takes hold of the hand of the Princess.</i>]</p>

<p>Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:<br/>
But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt;<br/>
For he&rsquo;s no man on whom perfections wait<br/>
That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate,<br/>
You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;<br/>
Who, finger&rsquo;d to make man his lawful music,<br/>
Would draw heaven down, and all the gods to hearken;<br/>
But being play&rsquo;d upon before your time,<br/>
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.<br/>
Good sooth, I care not for you.</p>

<p>ANTIOCHUS.<br/>
Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,<br/>
For that&rsquo;s an article within our law,<br/>
As dangerous as the rest. Your time&rsquo;s expired:<br/>
Either expound now, or receive your sentence.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Great king,<br/>
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;<br/>
&rsquo;Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.<br/>
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,<br/>
He&rsquo;s more secure to keep it shut than shown:<br/>
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind,<br/>
Blows dust in others&rsquo; eyes, to spread itself;<br/>
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,<br/>
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear.<br/>
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts<br/>
Copp&rsquo;d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is
throng&rsquo;d<br/>
By man&rsquo;s oppression; and the poor worm doth die for&rsquo;t.<br/>
Kind are earth&rsquo;s gods; in vice their law&rsquo;s their will;<br/>
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?<br/>
It is enough you know; and it is fit,<br/>
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.<br/>
All love the womb that their first bred,<br/>
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</p>

<p>ANTIOCHUS.<br/>
[<i>Aside</i>] Heaven, that I had thy head! He has found the meaning:<br/>
But I will gloze with him. &mdash; Young prince of Tyre.<br/>
Though by the tenour of our strict edict,<br/>
Your exposition misinterpreting,<br/>
We might proceed to cancel of your days;<br/>
Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree<br/>
As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:<br/>
Forty days longer we do respite you;<br/>
If by which time our secret be undone,<br/>
This mercy shows we&rsquo;ll joy in such a son:<br/>
And until then your entertain shall be<br/>
As doth befit our honour and your worth.</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt all but <span class="charname">Pericles</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
How courtesy would seem to cover sin,<br/>
When what is done is like an hypocrite,<br/>
The which is good in nothing but in sight!<br/>
If it be true that I interpret false,<br/>
Then were it certain you were not so bad<br/>
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;<br/>
Where now you&rsquo;re both a father and a son,<br/>
By your untimely claspings with your child,<br/>
Which pleasures fits a husband, not a father;<br/>
And she an eater of her mother&rsquo;s flesh,<br/>
By the defiling of her parent&rsquo;s bed;<br/>
And both like serpents are, who though they feed<br/>
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.<br/>
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men<br/>
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,<br/>
Will &rsquo;schew no course to keep them from the light.<br/>
One sin, I know, another doth provoke;<br/>
Murder&rsquo;s as near to lust as flame to smoke:<br/>
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,<br/>
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:<br/>
Then, lest my life be cropp&rsquo;d to keep you clear,<br/>
By flight I&rsquo;ll shun the danger which I fear.</p>

<p>ANTIOCHUS.<br/>

He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,<br/>
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin<br/>
In such a loathed manner;<br/>

We will advance you. Thaliard,<br/>
Behold, here&rsquo;s poison, and here&rsquo;s gold;<br/>
We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:<br/>
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,<br/>
Because we bid it. Say, is it done?</p>

Unless thou say &lsquo;Prince Pericles is dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
[<i>To Lords without.</i>] Let none disturb us. &mdash; Why should this change of thoughts,<br/>
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,<br/>
Be my so used a guest as not an hour<br/>
In the day&rsquo;s glorious walk or peaceful night,<br/>
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?<br/>
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,<br/>
And danger, which I fear&rsquo;d, is at Antioch,<br/>
Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here:<br/>
Yet neither pleasure&rsquo;s art can joy my spirits,<br/>
Nor yet the other&rsquo;s distance comfort me.<br/>
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,<br/>
That have their first conception by misdread,<br/>
Have after-nourishment and life by care;<br/>
And what was first but fear what might be done,<br/>
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.<br/>
And so with me: the great Antiochus,<br/>
&rsquo;Gainst whom I am too little to contend,<br/>
Since he&rsquo;s so great can make his will his act,<br/>
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;<br/>
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.<br/>
If he suspect I may dishonour him:<br/>
And what may make him blush in being known,<br/>
He&rsquo;ll stop the course by which it might be known;<br/>
With hostile forces he&rsquo;ll o&rsquo;erspread the land,<br/>
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,<br/>
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;<br/>
Our men be vanquish&rsquo;d ere they do resist,<br/>
And subjects punish&rsquo;d that ne&rsquo;er thought offence:<br/>
Which care of them, not pity of myself,<br/>
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,<br/>
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,<br/>

desired he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he had some

A city on whom plenty held full hand,<br/>
For riches strew&rsquo;d herself even in the streets;<br/>

They are now starved for want of exercise:<br/>

Must have inventions to delight the taste,<br/>
Would now be glad of bread and beg for it:<br/>

Thought nought too curious, are ready now<br/>
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.<br/>

Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:<br/>
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;<br/>
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall<br/>
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.<br/>

Nay, master, said not I as much when I
saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled? They say they&rsquo;re half
fish, half flesh: a plague on them, they ne&rsquo;er come but I look to
be washed. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</p>

<p>FIRST FISHERMAN.<br/>
Why, as men do a-land; the great ones
eat up the little ones: I can compare our rich misers to nothing so
fitly as to a whale; a&rsquo; plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry
before him, and at last devours them all at a mouthful. Such whales have

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,<br/>

And that you&rsquo;d guide me to your sovereign court,<br/>

<p>SECOND FISHERMAN.<br/>
Ay, but hark you, my friend;
&rsquo;twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the
waters: there are certain condolements, certain vails.  I hope, sir, if
you thrive, you&rsquo;ll remember from whence you had them.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Believe&rsquo;t I will.<br/>
By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;<br/>

Upon a courser, whose delightful steps<br/>
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.<br/>
Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided<br/>
Of a pair of bases.</p>

We&rsquo;ll sure provide: thou shalt
have my best gown to make thee a pair; and I&rsquo;ll bring thee to the

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
It&rsquo;s fit it should be so; for princes are<br/>
A model, which heaven makes like to itself:<br/>
As jewels lose their glory if neglected,<br/>
So princes their renowns if not respected.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis now your honour, daughter, to entertain<br/>
The labour of each knight in his device.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
Which, to preserve mine honour, I&rsquo;ll perform.</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> The first Knight passes by, and his Squire presents
his shield to Thaisa.</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
Who is the first that doth prefer himself?</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;<br/>
And the device he bears upon his shield<br/>
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun:<br/>
The word, <i>Lux tua vita mihi.</i></p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
He loves you well that holds his life of you.</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> The second Knight passes by, and his Squire presents

<p>Who is the second that presents himself?</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
A prince of Macedon, my royal father;<br/>
And the device he bears upon his shield<br/>

The motto thus, in Spanish, <i>Piu por dulzura que por forza.</i></p>

his shield to Thaisa.</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
A pretty moral;<br/>
From the dejected state wherein he is,<br/>
He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.</p>

<p>FIRST LORD.<br/>
He had need mean better than his outward show<br/>
Can any way speak in his just commend;<br/>
For by his rusty outside he appears<br/>
To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.</p>

He well may be a stranger, for he comes<br/>
To an honour&rsquo;d triumph strangely furnished.</p>

Until this day, to scour it in the dust.</p>

To say you&rsquo;re welcome were superfluous.<br/>
To place upon the volume of your deeds,<br/>

In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,<br/>
To make some good, but others to exceed;<br/>

For, daughter, so you are, &mdash; here take your place:<br/>
Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.</p>

We are honour&rsquo;d much by good Simonides.</p>

Sir, yonder is your place.</p>

Some other is more fit.</p>

<p>FIRST KNIGHT.<br/>
Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen<br/>
Have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes<br/>
Envied the great, nor shall the low despise.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
You are right courteous knights.</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
Sit, sir, sit.<br/>
By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,<br/>
These cates resist me, he but thought upon.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
By Juno, that is queen of marriage,<br/>
All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury,<br/>
Wishing him my meat. Sure, he&rsquo;s a gallant gentleman.</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
He&rsquo;s but a country gentleman;<br/>
Has done no more than other knights have done;<br/>
Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
To me he seems like diamond to glass.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Yon king&rsquo;s to me like to my father&rsquo;s picture,<br/>
Which tells me in that glory once he was;<br/>
Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,<br/>
And he the sun, for them to reverence;<br/>
None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,<br/>
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:<br/>
Where now his son&rsquo;s like a glow-worm in the night,<br/>
The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:<br/>
Whereby I see that time&rsquo;s the king of men,<br/>
He&rsquo;s both their parent, and he is their grave,<br/>
And gives them what he will, not what they crave.</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
What, are you merry, knights?</p>

<p>KNIGHTS.<br/>
Who can be other in this royal presence?</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
Here, with a cup that&rsquo;s stored unto the brim, &mdash;<br/>
As you do love, fill to your mistress&rsquo; lips, &mdash;<br/>
We drink this health to you.</p>

<p>KNIGHTS.<br/>
We thank your grace.</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
Yet pause awhile. Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,<br/>
As if the entertainment in our court<br/>
Had not a show might countervail his worth.<br/>
Note it not you, Thaisa?</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
What is&rsquo;t to me, my father?</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
O attend, my daughter:<br/>
Princes in this should live like god&rsquo;s above,<br/>
Who freely give to everyone that comes to honour them:<br/>
And princes not doing so are like to gnats,<br/>
Which make a sound, but kill&rsquo;d are wonder&rsquo;d at.<br/>
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,<br/>
Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
Alas, my father, it befits not me<br/>
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:<br/>
He may my proffer take for an offence,<br/>
Since men take women&rsquo;s gifts for impudence.</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
How? Do as I bid you, or you&rsquo;ll move me else.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.</p>

<p>SIMONIDES.<br/>
And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,<br/>
Of whence he is, his name and parentage.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
I thank him.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
Wishing it so much blood unto your life.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.</p>

A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;<br/>
My education been in arts and arms;<br/>
Who, looking for adventures in the world,<br/>
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,<br/>
And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.</p>

He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,<br/>
A gentleman of Tyre,<br/>
Who only by misfortune of the seas<br/>
Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.</p>

Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,<br/>
And will awake him from his melancholy.<br/>
Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,<br/>
And waste the time, which looks for other revels.<br/>
Even in your armours, as you are address&rsquo;d,<br/>
Will well become a soldier&rsquo;s dance.<br/>

Of this most pompous marriage feast.<br/>
The cat, with eyne of burning coal,<br/>
Now couches fore the mouse&rsquo;s hole;<br/>
And crickets sing at the oven&rsquo;s mouth,<br/>
Are the blither for their drouth.<br/>
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,<br/>
Where, by the loss of maidenhead,<br/>
A babe is moulded.  Be attent,<br/>
And time that is so briefly spent<br/>
With your fine fancies quaintly eche:<br/>
What&rsquo;s dumb in show I&rsquo;ll plain with speech.</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Dumb-show. Enter, <span class="charname">Pericles</span> and <span class="charname">Simonides</span> at one door with
Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives Pericles a letter:
Pericles shows it Simonides; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter <span class="charname">Thaisa</span> with child, with <span class="charname">Lychorida,</span> a nurse. The King shows her the letter; she
rejoices:  she and Pericles take leave of her father, and depart, with
Lychorida and their Attendants. Then exeunt Simonides and the rest.</p>

<p>By many a dern and painful perch<br/>
Of Pericles the careful search,<br/>
By the four opposing coigns<br/>
Which the world together joins,<br/>
Is made with all due diligence<br/>
That horse and sail and high expense<br/>
Can stead the quest.  At last from Tyre,<br/>
Fame answering the most strange enquire,<br/>
To th&rsquo; court of King Simonides<br/>
Are letters brought, the tenour these:<br/>
Antiochus and his daughter dead;<br/>
The men of Tyrus on the head<br/>
Of Helicanus would set on<br/>
The crown of Tyre, but he will none:<br/>
The mutiny he there hastes t&rsquo;oppress;<br/>
Says to &rsquo;em, if King Pericles<br/>
Come not home in twice six moons,<br/>
He, obedient to their dooms,<br/>
Will take the crown.  The sum of this,<br/>
Brought hither to Pentapolis<br/>
Y-ravished the regions round,<br/>
And everyone with claps can sound,<br/>
&lsquo;Our heir apparent is a king!<br/>
Who dreamt, who thought of such a thing?&rsquo;<br/>
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:<br/>
His queen with child makes her desire &mdash;<br/>
Which who shall cross? &mdash; along to go:<br/>
Omit we all their dole and woe:<br/>
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,<br/>
And so to sea.  Their vessel shakes<br/>
On Neptune&rsquo;s billow; half the flood<br/>
Hath their keel cut: but fortune&rsquo;s mood<br/>
Varies again; the grisled north<br/>
Disgorges such a tempest forth,<br/>
That, as a duck for life that dives,<br/>
So up and down the poor ship drives:<br/>
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near<br/>
Does fall in travail with her fear:<br/>
And what ensues in this fell storm<br/>
Shall for itself itself perform.<br/>
I nill relate, action may<br/>
Conveniently the rest convey;<br/>
Which might not what by me is told.<br/>
In your imagination hold<br/>
This stage the ship, upon whose deck<br/>
The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.</p>

<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN.<br/>
Sir, our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,<br/>

That is the cause we trouble you so early;<br/>

Nature should be so conversant with pain.<br/>
Being thereto not compell&rsquo;d.</p>

<p>CERIMON.<br/>
I hold it ever,<br/>
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater<br/>
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs<br/>

But immortality attends the former,<br/>
Making a man a god. &rsquo;Tis known, I ever<br/>

By turning o&rsquo;er authorities, I have,<br/>
Together with my practice, made familiar<br/>

That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;<br/>
And I can speak of the disturbances<br/>

Of education all the grace,<br/>
Which makes her both the heart and place<br/>
Of general wonder. But, alack,<br/>
That monster envy, oft the wrack<br/>
Of earned praise, Marina&rsquo;s life<br/>
Seeks to take off by treason&rsquo;s knife,<br/>
And in this kind our Cleon hath<br/>
One daughter, and a full grown wench<br/>
Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid<br/>
Hight Philoten: and it is said<br/>
For certain in our story, she<br/>
Would ever with Marina be.<br/>
Be&rsquo;t when she weaved the sleided silk<br/>
With fingers long, small, white as milk;<br/>
Or when she would with sharp needle wound,<br/>
The cambric, which she made more sound<br/>
By hurting it; or when to th&rsquo; lute<br/>
She sung, and made the night-bird mute<br/>
That still records with moan; or when<br/>
She would with rich and constant pen<br/>
Vail to her mistress Dian; still<br/>
This Philoten contends in skill<br/>
With absolute Marina: so<br/>
The dove of Paphos might with the crow<br/>
Vie feathers white.  Marina gets<br/>
All praises, which are paid as debts,<br/>
And not as given. This so darks<br/>
In Philoten all graceful marks,<br/>
That Cleon&rsquo;s wife, with envy rare,<br/>
A present murderer does prepare<br/>
For good Marina, that her daughter<br/>
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.<br/>
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,<br/>
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:<br/>

The pregnant instrument of wrath<br/>
Prest for this blow. The unborn event<br/>

I love the king your father, and yourself,<br/>
With more than foreign heart. We every day<br/>
Expect him here: when he shall come and find<br/>
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,<br/>
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;<br/>
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken<br/>
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,<br/>
Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve<br/>
That excellent complexion, which did steal<br/>
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me;<br/>
I can go home alone.</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
Well, I will go;<br/>
But yet I have no desire to it.</p>

<p>LEONINE.<br/>
South-west.</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
When I was born the wind was north.</p>

<p>LEONINE.<br/>
Was&rsquo;t so?</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
My father, as nurse said, did never fear,<br/>
But cried &lsquo;Good seamen!&rsquo; to the sailors,<br/>
Galling his kingly hands, haling ropes;<br/>
And clasping to the mast, endured a sea<br/>
That almost burst the deck.</p>

<p>LEONINE.<br/>
When was this?</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
When I was born:<br/>
Never was waves nor wind more violent;<br/>
And from the ladder tackle washes off<br/>
A canvas-climber. &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; says one, &lsquo;wolt out?&rsquo;<br/>
And with a dropping industry they skip<br/>
From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and<br/>
The master calls and trebles their confusion.</p>

<p>LEONINE.<br/>
Come, say your prayers.</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
What mean you?</p>

<p>LEONINE.<br/>
If you require a little space for prayer,<br/>
I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,<br/>
For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn<br/>
To do my work with haste.</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
Why will you kill me?</p>

<p>LEONINE.<br/>
To satisfy my lady.</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
Why would she have me kill&rsquo;d now?<br/>
As I can remember, by my troth,<br/>
I never did her hurt in all my life:<br/>
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn<br/>
To any living creature: believe me, la,<br/>
I never kill&rsquo;d a mouse, nor hurt a fly:<br/>
I trod upon a worm against my will,<br/>
But I wept for it.  How have I offended,<br/>
Wherein my death might yield her any profit,<br/>
Or my life imply her any danger?</p>

<p>LEONINE.<br/>
My commission<br/>
Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
You will not do&rsquo;t for all the world, I hope.<br/>
You are well favour&rsquo;d, and your looks foreshow<br/>
You have a gentle heart.  I saw you lately,<br/>
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:<br/>
Good sooth, it show&rsquo;d well in you: do so now:<br/>
Your lady seeks my life; come you between,<br/>
And save poor me, the weaker.</p>

<p>BOULT.<br/>
Sir?</p>

<p>PANDAR.<br/>
Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of
gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless.</p>

<p>BAWD.<br/>
We were never so much out of creatures. We have
but poor three, and they can do no more than they can do; and they with
continual action are even as good as rotten.</p>

<p>PANDAR.<br/>
Therefore let&rsquo;s have fresh ones, whate&rsquo;er we pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper.</p>

<p>BAWD.<br/>
Thou sayest true: &rsquo;tis not our bringing up
of poor bastards, &mdash; as, I think, I have brought up some eleven
&mdash;</p>

<p>BOULT.<br/>
Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But
shall I search the market?</p>

<p>BAWD.<br/>
What else, man?  The stuff we have, a strong wind
will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.</p>

<p>PANDAR.<br/>
Thou sayest true; they&rsquo;re too unwholesome,
o&rsquo; conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the
little baggage.</p>

<p>BOULT.<br/>
Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms.
But I&rsquo;ll go search the market.</p>

<p>PANDAR.<br/>
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a

<p>BAWD.<br/>
Why to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get
when we are old?</p>

<p>PANDAR.<br/>
O, our credit comes not in like the commodity,
nor the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore, if in our youths
we could pick up some pretty estate, &rsquo;twere not amiss to keep our
door hatched.  Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will
be strong with us for giving over.</p>

<p>BAWD.<br/>
Come, others sorts offend as well as we.</p>

No.</p>

hairs; I have drawn her picture with my voice.</p>

<p>BAWD.<br/>
And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the
inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?</p>

<p>BOULT.<br/>
Faith, they listened to me as they would
have hearkened to their father&rsquo;s testament.  There was a
Spaniard&rsquo;s mouth so watered, that he went to bed to her very

Who, Monsieur Veroles?</p>

<p>BOULT.<br/>
Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the
proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her
tomorrow.</p>

<p>BAWD.<br/>
Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease
hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow,
to scatter his crowns in the sun.</p>

Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we
should lodge them with this sign.</p>

<p>[<i>To Marina.</i>] Pray you, come hither awhile. You have
fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully
which you commit willingly, despise profit where you have most gain. To
weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers: seldom but that
pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.</p>

I understand you not.</p>

<p>BOULT.<br/>
O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these

Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.</p>

Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a
sojourner we have; you&rsquo;ll lose nothing by custom. When nature
framed this piece, she meant thee a good turn; therefore say what a
paragon she is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report.</p>

Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess<br/>
To equal any single crown o&rsquo; the earth<br/>
I&rsquo; the justice of compare!  O villain Leonine!<br/>
Whom thou hast poison&rsquo;d too:<br/>
If thou hadst drunk to him, &rsquo;t had been a kindness<br/>
Becoming well thy face. What canst thou say<br/>
When noble Pericles shall demand his child?</p>

<p>DIONYZA.<br/>
That she is dead.  Nurses are not the fates,<br/>
To foster it, nor ever to preserve.<br/>
She died at night; I&rsquo;ll say so. Who can cross it?<br/>
Unless you play the pious innocent,<br/>
And for an honest attribute cry out<br/>
&lsquo;She died by foul play.&rsquo;</p>

O, go to.  Well, well,<br/>
Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods<br/>
Do like this worst.</p>

Be one of those that thinks<br/>

To think of what a noble strain you are,<br/>
And of how coward a spirit.</p>

Though not his prime consent, he did not flow<br/>
From honourable sources,</p>

<p>DIONYZA.<br/>
Be it so, then:<br/>
Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,<br/>
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.<br/>
She did distain my child, and stood between<br/>
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,<br/>
But cast their gazes on Marina&rsquo;s face;<br/>
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin<br/>
Not worth the time of day.  It pierced me through;<br/>
And though you call my course unnatural,<br/>
You not your child well loving, yet I find<br/>
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness<br/>
Perform&rsquo;d to your sole daughter.</p>

<p>CLEON.<br/>
Heavens forgive it!</p>

And as for Pericles, what should he say?<br/>
We wept after her hearse, and yet we mourn.<br/>
Her monument is almost finish&rsquo;d, and her epitaphs<br/>
In glittering golden characters express<br/>
A general praise to her, and care in us<br/>
At whose expense &rsquo;tis done.</p>

Next, he&rsquo;s the governor of this country, and

What trade, sir?</p>

I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.</p>

How long have you been of this profession?</p>

Earlier, too, sir, if now I be one.</p>

<p>LYSIMACHUS.<br/>
Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to

Why, your herb-woman;  she that sets seeds

power, and so stand aloof for more serious wooing. But I protest to
thee, pretty one, my authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly

you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg, and have

Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,<br/>
With other virtues, which I&rsquo;ll keep from boast;<br/>

Yield many scholars.</p>

them. But since my master and mistress have bought you, there&rsquo;s no

What was thy mother&rsquo;s name? tell me but that,<br/>
For truth can never be confirm&rsquo;d enough,<br/>
Though doubts did ever sleep.</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
First, sir, I pray, what is your title?</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now<br/>
My drown&rsquo;d queen&rsquo;s name, as in the rest you said<br/>
Thou hast been godlike perfect,<br/>
The heir of kingdoms and another life<br/>
To Pericles thy father.</p>

<p>MARINA.<br/>
Is it no more to be your daughter than<br/>
To say my mother&rsquo;s name was Thaisa?<br/>
Thaisa was my mother, who did end<br/>
The minute I began.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.<br/>
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;<br/>
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,<br/>
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;<br/>
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge<br/>
She is thy very princess. Who is this?</p>

<p>HELICANUS.<br/>
Sir, &rsquo;tis the governor of Mytilene,<br/>
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,<br/>
Did come to see you.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
I embrace you.<br/>
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.<br/>
O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?<br/>
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him<br/>
O&rsquo;er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,<br/>
How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?</p>

<p>HELICANUS.<br/>
My lord, I hear none.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
None!<br/>
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.</p>

<p>LYSIMACHUS.<br/>
It is not good to cross him; give him way.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?</p>

<p>LYSIMACHUS.<br/>
Music, my lord? I hear.</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Music.</i>]</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Most heavenly music!<br/>
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber<br/>
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.</p>

<p>LYSIMACHUS.<br/>

Before the people all,<br/>

To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter&rsquo;s, call<br/>
And give them repetition to the life.<br/>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,<br/>
I here confess myself the King of Tyre;<br/>
Who, frighted from my country, did wed<br/>
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.<br/>
At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth<br/>
A maid child call&rsquo;d Marina; whom, O goddess,<br/>
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus<br/>
Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years<br/>
He sought to murder: but her better stars<br/>
Brought her to Mytilene; &rsquo;gainst whose shore<br/>
Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,<br/>
Where by her own most clear remembrance, she<br/>
Made known herself my daughter.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
Voice and favour!<br/>
You are, you are &mdash; O royal Pericles!</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Faints.</i>]</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
What means the nun? She dies! help, gentlemen!</p>

<p>CERIMON.<br/>
Noble sir,<br/>
If you have told Diana&rsquo;s altar true,<br/>
This is your wife.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Reverend appearer, no;<br/>
I threw her overboard with these very arms.</p>

<p>CERIMON.<br/>
Upon this coast, I warrant you.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis most certain.</p>

<p>CERIMON.<br/>
Look to the lady; O, she&rsquo;s but o&rsquo;er-joy&rsquo;d.<br/>
Early in blustering morn this lady was<br/>
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,<br/>
Found there rich jewels; recover&rsquo;d her, and placed her<br/>
Here in Diana&rsquo;s temple.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
May we see them?</p>

<p>CERIMON.<br/>
Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,<br/>
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is<br/>
Recovered.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
O, let me look!<br/>
If he be none of mine, my sanctity<br/>
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,<br/>
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,<br/>
Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,<br/>
Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,<br/>
A birth, and death?</p>

I left behind an ancient substitute:<br/>
Can you remember what I call&rsquo;d the man<br/>
I have named him oft.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
&rsquo;Twas Helicanus then.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Still confirmation:<br/>
Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.<br/>
Now do I long to hear how you were found:<br/>
How possibly preserved; and who to thank,<br/>
Besides the gods, for this great miracle.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,<br/>
Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can<br/>
From first to last resolve you.</p>

Reverend sir,<br/>
The gods can have no mortal officer<br/>
More like a god than you. Will you deliver<br/>
How this dead queen relives?</p>

<p>CERIMON.<br/>
I will, my lord.<br/>
Beseech you, first go with me to my house,<br/>
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;<br/>
How she came placed here in the temple;<br/>
No needful thing omitted.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I<br/>
Will offer night-oblations to thee.  Thaisa,<br/>
This prince, the fair betrothed of your daughter,<br/>
Shall marry her at Pentapolis.<br/>
And now this ornament<br/>
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;<br/>
And what this fourteen years no razor touch&rsquo;d<br/>
To grace thy marriage-day, I&rsquo;ll beautify.</p>

<p>THAISA.<br/>
Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,<br/>
My father&rsquo;s dead.</p>

<p>PERICLES.<br/>
Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,<br/>
We&rsquo;ll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves<br/>
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:<br/>
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.<br/>
Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay<br/>

In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard<br/>
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:<br/>
In Pericles, his queen and daughter seen,<br/>
Although assail&rsquo;d with Fortune fierce and keen,<br/>
Virtue preserved from fell destruction&rsquo;s blast,<br/>
Led on by heaven, and crown&rsquo;d with joy at last.<br/>
In Helicanus may you well descry<br/>
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:<br/>
In reverend Cerimon there well appears<br/>
The worth that learned charity aye wears:<br/>
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame<br/>
Had spread their cursed deed, the honour&rsquo;d name<br/>
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,<br/>
That him and his they in his palace burn.<br/>
The gods for murder seemed so content<br/>
To punish, although not done, but meant.<br/>
So on your patience evermore attending,<br/>
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
